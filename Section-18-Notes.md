          - Members

            - Create a brand-new role
            - Event Planner
            - Checkboxes
              - Posts, Pages
        - We don't see a tab for our Custom Post Types!
        - New CPTs are usually treated as Blog Posts
        - Edit the code where we registered the Event Post Type
          - mu-plugins/Custom-Post-Types/cpt-event.php
          - We want to tell the Event Post Type that it should not behave like a Blog Post when it comes to Permissions and Capabilities. Instead, it should require its own UNIQUE Permissions and Capabilities.
